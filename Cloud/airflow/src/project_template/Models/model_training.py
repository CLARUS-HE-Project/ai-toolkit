"""
This module defines the `model_training` function used by the pipeline orchestrator to train a machine 
learning model using ElasticNet regularization. This function defines the logic for training the model and evaluating 
its performance.

Any additional functions or utilities required for this step can be defined within this script itself or split into 
different scripts and included in the Process directory.
